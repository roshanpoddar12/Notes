  # WHAT IS WEBARCHITECTURE?
  
  - Web architecture involves multiple components like database, message queue, cache, user interface & all running in conjunction with each other to form an online service.
  
  - In the introduction of this course, I already talked about why the knowledge of web architecture is important to software engineers. Now we will explore it further.

  - This is a typical architecture of a web application, used in the majority of the applications running online.

  Iâ€™ll step by step go through every component starting with the client-server architecture.
