  ## 13.Different Types of databases
  
  There are quite a number of different types of databases available to the application developers, catering to specific use cases.
  
  Such as the:
  
  Document-Oriented database
  Key-value datastore
  Wide-column database
  Relational database
  Graph database
  Time-Series database
  Databases dedicated to mobile apps
  In the polyglot persistence lesson, we went through the need for different types of databases. We have also covered relational databases in-depth when to pick a relational one & stuff in the previous lessons.
  
  Now we will have insights into the other remaining types of databases and the use cases which fit them.
  
  So, without any further ado. Letâ€™s get on with it.
