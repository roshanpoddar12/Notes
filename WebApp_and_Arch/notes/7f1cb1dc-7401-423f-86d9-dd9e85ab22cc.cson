  ## 9. Multi-Model Databases
  
  ### What are the multi-model databases?
  Until now the databases supported only one data model, it could either be a relational database, a graph database or any other database with a certain specific data model.
  
  But with the advent of multi-model databases, we have the ability to use different data models in a single database system.
  
  Multi-model databases support multiple data models like Graph, Document-Oriented, Relational etc. as opposed to supporting only one data model.
  
  They also avert the need for managing multiple persistence technologies in a single service. They reduce the operational complexity by notches. With multi-model databases, we can leverage different data models via a single API.

  ## Popular multi model databases 
  Some of the popular multi-model databases are Arango DB, Cosmos DB, Orient DB, Couchbase etc.
  
  So, by now we are clear on what NoSQL databases are & when to pick them and stuff. Now letâ€™s understand concepts like Eventual Consistency, Strong Consistency which are key to understanding distributed systems.
