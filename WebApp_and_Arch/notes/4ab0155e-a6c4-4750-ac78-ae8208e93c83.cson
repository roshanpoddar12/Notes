  # CLIENT
  
  - The client holds our user interface. The user interface is the presentation part of the application. Itâ€™s written in Html, JavaScript, CSS and is responsible for the look & feel of the application.
  
  - The user interface runs on the client. The client can be a mobile app, a desktop or a tablet like an iPad. It can also be a web-based console, running commands to interact with the backend server.
  
  - Technologies Used To Implement Clients In Web Applications #
  - In very simple terms, a client is the window to our application. In the industry, the open-source technologies popular for writing the web-based user interface are ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, Jquery etc. All these libraries use JavaScript.
  
  - There are a plethora of other technologies for writing the front-end too, I have just listed the popular ones for now.
  
  - Different platforms require different frameworks & libraries to write front-end. For instance, mobile phones running Android would need a different set of tools, those running Apple or Windows OS would need a different set of tools.
