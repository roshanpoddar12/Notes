  #  TYPES OF CLIENT
  
  - There are 2 types of client 
    - Thin Client
    - Thick Client
  
  ## Thin Client #
  Thin Client is the client which holds just the user interface of the application. It has no business logic of any sort. For every action, the client sends a request to the backend server. Just like in a three-tier application.

  ## Thick Client #
  On the contrary, the thick client holds all or some part of the business logic. These are the two-tier applications. Weâ€™ve already gone through this if you remember.
  
  The typical examples of Fat clients are utility apps, online games etc.
