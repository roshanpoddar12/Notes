  # SERVER
  
  ## What Is A Web Server? 
  - The primary task of a web server is to receive the requests from the client & provide the response after executing the business logic based on the request parameters received from the client.
  
  - Every service, running online, needs a server to run. Servers running web applications are commonly known as the application servers.
  
  
  
  - Besides the application servers, there are other kinds of servers too with specific tasks assigned to them such as the:
  
    - Proxy server
    - Mail server
    - File server
    - Virtual server
  The server configuration & the type can differ depending on the use case.
  
  For instance, if we run a backend application code written in Java, we would pick Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
  
  For simple use cases such as hosting websites, we would pick the Apache HTTP Server.
  
  In this lesson, we will stick to the application server.
  
  All the components of a web application need a server to run. Be it a database, a message queue, a cache or any other component. In modern application development, even the user interface is hosted separately on a dedicated server.
  
  
  ## Server-Side Rendering 
  - Often the developers use a server to render the user interface on the backend & then send the rendered data to the client. The technique is known as server-side rendering. I will discuss the pros & cons of client-side vs server-side rendering further down the course.
  
  - Now we have a fundamental understanding of both the client & the server. Letâ€™s delve into some of the concepts involved in the communication between them.
